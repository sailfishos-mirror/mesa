# Note: skips lists for CI are just a list of lines that, when
# non-zero-length and not starting with '#', will regex match to
# delete lines from the test list.  Be careful.

# Slow tests that aren't very useful coverage, but pass otherwise.  94% CPU
# used in ir3 create_variant, but no single pass there dominating its time.
# Just use the scalar/vec2 cases, which are fast enough for CI.
